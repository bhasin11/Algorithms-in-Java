# Algorithms-in-Java

<b>Algorithms, Data Structures</b> and <b>Coding Challenges</b> implemented in Java.

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges which I've implement over a period of time.

| <b>Excel Sheet Column Title</b>  <br>Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet. For example: 1 -> A, 2 -> B, 3 -> C ...  26 -> Z,  27 -> AA, 28 -> AB     | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/convertToTitle.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>First Bad Version</b>  <br>You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/isBadVersion.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>Reverse Integer</b>  <br>Reverse digits of an integer. Example1: x = 123, return 321. Example2: x = -123, return -321 | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/reverse.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>Rotate Array</b>  <br>Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps. For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/rotate.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>Battleships in a Board</b>  <br>Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/countBattleships.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>Counting Bits</b>  <br>Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array. Example: For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2]. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/countBits.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>Find Bottom Left Tree Value</b>  <br>Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/findBottomLeftValue.java)                               |Easy|
| <b>Arithmetic Slices</b>  <br>A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/numberOfArithmeticSlices.java)                               |Easy|

| <b> Find All Duplicates in an Array</b>  <br>Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Example: Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1] Output: [2,3] | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-Java/blob/master/src/findDuplicates.java)                               |Easy|
